# ANOMALY DETECTION METHODS ON THE ATLAS EXPERIMENT
You can find here the scripts for all the models trained and studied during this project.
All semi-supervised models were trained on the background and tested on both background and signals (4 types of signals).
The contaminated models were trained with the background and signals while using 'normalisedCombinedWeight' as the train_weight.
